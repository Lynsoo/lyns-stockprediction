Historical data extraction from sources like Yahoo Finance and Wikipedia and preprocessing.
- Model definition and training
- Testing and validation
- Forecasted data visualization
- Deployment on StreamLit

## Tech Stack 

This project is built using the following technologies : 
- StreamLit - a platform for production deployment ( for the user interface)
- Python
- Yahoo Finance - provides stock data
- Pandas - a dataframe management library
- Matplotlib - data visualization
