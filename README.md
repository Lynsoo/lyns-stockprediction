## Project Overview

This project aims to create an app based on an LSTM model,a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which are well-suited for sequential data such as stock prices, that predicts the stock prices for S&P 500 and European companies. 

This repository contains code for:
- Downloading historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Preprocessing and normalizing the data.
- Building and training LSTM models to forecast stock prices.
- Visualizing the prediction results against actual prices.

##  Features
- Data Acquisition: Automatically fetches historical stock data using yfinance.
- Data Preprocessing: Scales and formats data for time series modeling.
- LSTM Model: Implements an LSTM neural network for regression on stock price sequences.
- Prediction & Visualization: Generates future price predictions and plots them alongside actual data.
- Deployment for production on Streamlit
